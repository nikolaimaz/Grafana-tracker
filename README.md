# Grafana-tracker
My project for Quarqs test case 

Main targer was to create Dashboard using Grafana for visualisation,
Prometheus for reciving data and BlackBox exporter for tracking and expoting data + all ofit must be containerized in docker.

## **Scope of tasks** 

1) Grafana

Build a graph based on metrics
probe_http_duration_seconds.
This graph should show the difference
current phase values and values that were yesterday at that time
same time


Visualization:
write labels in the graphic legend in the format: phase â€“ target,
display values on the graph on the right, with a table.
Enable stack series of values on the graph


2) Prometheus

Create an Alert

Condition:
if the average value of the probe_duration_seconds metric
within one minute for more than 2 seconds


3) Blackbox exporter

Configuration tasks:
consider the probe result unsuccessful if on the site which
we want to monitor through the http_2xx module
ssl is disabled
